## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

This project is configured to be deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

1.  **Connect your Git repository to Cloudflare Pages.**
2.  In the build settings, select **Next.js** as the "Framework preset". Cloudflare will automatically configure the build command and output directory.
3.  **Add Environment Variables.** If your project requires environment variables (e.g., for Firebase configuration if you weren't using the App Hosting SDK), add them in the Cloudflare Pages project settings under `Settings` > `Environment variables`.
4.  **Deploy.** Cloudflare Pages will automatically build and deploy your site.
