/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for Lawlane application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes secure access to lawyer profiles based on their status and ownership.
 * It enforces that only approved lawyer profiles are publicly readable, while ensuring that only the owner (identified by `userId`) can create, update, or delete their own profile.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * Lawyer profiles are stored in the `/lawyerProfiles/{lawyerProfileId}` collection. Each document contains a `userId` field linking it to a specific Firebase User ID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Lawyer profiles with a status of "approved" are publicly readable.
 * - Owner-Only Writes: Only the lawyer who owns the profile (identified by `userId`) can create, update, or delete it.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The `userId` field is denormalized directly onto the `lawyerProfiles` documents to allow for efficient ownership checks without additional reads.

     * @principle Enforces owner-only writes and public read access for approved profiles.
